**bike de boa** is an open and colaborative map of places to park bikes in the city. It's focused on being super easy to use and also educative: at the same time you learn where are the bike parkings around you, you know if they are safe to use and why they are so.

Everyone can add new places and review existing one. and reviewing places to park your bike.

This project is (Progressive) Web App, which runs smoothly on both Desktop and Mobile and different from regular bike apps, it's totally indexable by search engines.
